 abstract = {Magnetic filters are used effectively in many industrial areas to clean up technological liquids and gases from micron and submicron size magnetic particles. Performance of the magnetic filter is affected by technological parameters like flow rate of the industrial liquid and concentration and flux magnitude of the magnetic filter. These parameters exhibit differences depending on the field of work. Controlling of magnetic filters without regard to these parameters has disadvantages such as low filter performance, ineffectiveness in parameter changes and high energy consumption. To remove these disadvantages, an adaptive fuzzy control system which considers these technological parameters was designed and realized. When the realized filter is compared to the filter that ignores technological parameters, it is observed that energy can be saved at a rate of 68% annually.},
