 abstract = {In this study, chronic intestine illness symptoms such as sedimentation and prostate specific antigen are used for the design of fuzzy expert system to determine the drug (salazopyrine) dose. Suitable drug dose for patients is obtained by using data of ten patients. The results of some patients are compared with the doses recommended to them by the physician. As a result, it has been seen that proposed system is helped to shorten the treatment duration and minimize or remove the negative effects of determination of drug dose for helping physicians.},
