  Depending on the development of robotic technologies and systems, robots have
  begun to be preferred in the industry for jobs that are dangerous and tiring
  for humans. The most common are welding robots, which have application areas
  such as automotive, household appliances, defense industry, medical, and
  aerospace. Welding robots automate welding applications and provide speed,
  time, and safety to the manufacturer. They can sustain heavy-duty cycles in an
  unchanging and uninterrupted manner. However, since automating the welding
  process is not under human control, it creates an uncontrolled process against
  possible errors. Current welding robots are programmed by an operator and the
  welding process is performed depending on the parameters determined by the
  operator. In addition, failure to maintain precision in measurements during
  the weld path programming causes errors. During welding, robot systems are
  unresponsive to known problems such as material distortion and arc blowing.
  The fact that the parameters are preloaded into the system and the absence of
  a real-time control structure makes the welding robots uncontrolled against
  errors that may occur during welding. This situation causes work, time,
  productivity, and financial loss. Different quality measurement and evaluation
  systems have been proposed in the literature after welding processes performed
  with welding robots. However, welding quality measurement was provided in
  these systems, and an error-proof control system was not developed. However,
  there is a need for a real-time control mechanism for automatic determination
  of the weld path. In this thesis study, a real-time system is proposed to
  prevent errors before they occur, to automate the programming process, and to
  provide an adaptive control structure in welding works performed by welding
  robots. The proposed system has been implemented on Field Programmable Gate
  Arrays (FPGA) due to its advantages, such as parallel processing and instant
  response to multiple tasks due to the computational load required for image
  processing and instant control. The data received using a camera and laser
  module was processed using image processing techniques to determine the weld
  path. The obtained data was transferred to the adaptive fuzzy logic controller
  as input information. The developed controller structure has obtained an
  adaptive speed control and welding path tracking system for welding robots.
  The experimental studies concluded that the developed system could
  successfully determine the weld path geometry and follow the weld path on a
  prototype.
