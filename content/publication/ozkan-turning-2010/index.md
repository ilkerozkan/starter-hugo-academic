abstract: "In this study, fuzzy expert system (FES) and artificial neural network (ANN) models are designed for the estimation of cutting forces in turning operations. On designed models, cutting forces and experimental temperature data obtained from different cutting conditions were used in process of turning. Cutting forces at different cutting conditions and temperature values can be estimated with the help of developed models. The results obtained with these models, compared with the experimental data. The regression values were found as 0.99505 between the Experiment-FES and, 0.9888 between Experiment-ANN in the analysis. As a result, the both artificial intelligence (AI) methods have made successful modeling, but it's seen that, realized FES model has more successful results than the ANN model in the process of estimation of cutting forces."
