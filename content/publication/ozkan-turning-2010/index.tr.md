abstract: In this study, fuzzy expert system (FES) and artificial neural network
  (ANN) models are designed for the estimation of cutting forces in turning
  operations. On designed models, cutting forces and experimental temperature
  data obtained from different cutting conditions were used in process of
  turning. Cutting forces at different cutting conditions and temperature values
  can be estimated with the help of developed models. The results obtained with
  these models, compared with the experimental data. The regression values were
  found as 0.99505 between the Experiment-FES and, 0.9888 between Experiment-ANN
  in the analysis. As a result, the both artificial intelligence (AI) methods
  have made successful modeling, but it's seen that, realized FES model has more
  successful results than the ANN model in the process of estimation of cutting
  forces.
