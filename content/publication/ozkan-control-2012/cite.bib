 abstract = {One of the most effective methods to clean magnetic particles in industrial liquids is magnetic filtration. Magnetic filters (MF) are being used increasingly since they can work under various conditions like high temperature and radioactivity. However, there are many factors like particle concentration and flow speed that affect magnetic filter performance (MFP). In this study, a portable, compact MF kit that cleans micron-sized magnetic particles and is suitable for industrial purposes was designed and realized. A FPGA based fuzzy control system that considers the factors which influence MF performance was developed and integrated with MF kit. With this control system both the MF performance is kept at maximum and MF can clean itself. Thus, besides an effective filtration process which increases quality, sustainability of production and energy save is achieved.},
