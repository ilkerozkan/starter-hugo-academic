  Cloud computing is one of the leading technological advancements in the 21st
  century. Cloud computing can be defined as the delivery of a wide range of
  computing services over the Internet. These services are databases, software,
  servers, storage, networking, and other resources. Cloud computing provides
  faster innovation, flexible resources, and economical services. It follows the
  pay-per-use rule. Load balancing is a method of fairly sharing the workload
  between all nodes of virtual machines in cloud computing. Some of the most
  significant issues in cloud computing are task scheduling and load balancing
  amongst virtual machines as customers access dispersed data centers from
  various continents. Different algorithms are proposed to tackle this problem,
  many of which are successful with some limitations. We also proposed a hybrid
  algorithm based on two existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm takes
  advantage of the existing features of Throttled load balancing algorithm and
  ESCE algorithm and improves them to provide better load distribution between
  virtual machines. In this thesis, an improved hybrid loadbalancing algorithm
  has been developed. Load distribution is performed to virtual machines based
  on the properties of the virtual machines. The number of allocated tasks to a
  virtual machine and its bandwidth are the factors considered when choosing
  virtual machines. Two virtual machines are picked randomly, and the one with
  the higher weight is selected for the task. According to the experiments, the
  proposed algorithm has better performance and efficiency than the three
  algorithms presented in this study in terms of load distribution and response
  time relatively based on the property of the virtual machine.
