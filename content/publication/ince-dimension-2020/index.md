abstract: "The development of image processing technology appears in agriculture
  as well as in many other fields. Various classifications are carried out for
  fruits and vegetables. These are processes such as determining the harvest
  time according to their degree of maturity, deciding the way of collection and
  performing packaging operations according to their dimension. This study aims
  to classify the fruit according to its intended use in order to benefit more
  from the olive fruit that is important in industrial terms. In this study,
  olive fruit is classified as big, medium, and small according to its
  dimensions. Also classified as black and green according to their colors. This
  classification process was made in MATLAB environment and the KNN algorithm
  and decision trees was used. The results are obtained with Euclid and
  Manhattan methods used with the KNN algorithm and are given comparatively.
  According to the application results, 100% success was achieved in both
  methods in color classification. In dimension classification, 89.2%
  classification success was achieved in KNN algorithm and 86.7% in decision
  tree method.Keywords: Image processing, olive classification, KNN
  classification algorithm, decision tree."
