  Feedforward neural networks are a very popular and frequently used network
  architecture in many predictive applications. In these architectures, the
  information flow between neurons is from the input layer to the output layer.
  Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a feed forward neural network algorithm with
  a single hidden layer. Unlike conventional feedforward neural networks, the
  input weights (w) and weight bias (b) are randomly determined in ELM, and the
  weights of the neurons in the output layer are calculated analytically using
  the generalized matrix inversion method called Moore-Penrose. Instead of
  iteratively adjusting neural network parameters with gradient-based
  algorithms, it was observed that the learning speed and generalization
  performance increased with analytical computation in ELM. Although random
  selection of input weight and hidden bias parameters in ELM enables the
  learning process to happen very quickly, generalization performance does not
  give a good result in some cases. In addition, ELM may require more neurons in
  the hidden layer compared to gradient-based algorithms. For these reasons,
  there are studies to determine the optimum values of input weights and hidden
  bias values. In this study, meta-heuristic optimization algorithms were used
  to determine the optimum values of the ELM parameters. The output weights of
  ELM are calculated analytically by using the determined optimum input weights
  and hidden bias values. In addition to swarm intelligence algorithms such as
  Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Competitive Swarm Optimizer (CSO), which
  were previously applied in the optimization of ELM, a new ELM optimization
  model was developed with Harris' Hawks Optimization (HHO). These hybrid models
  developed for the optimization of ELM were tested on open access data sets and
  the results obtained were compared with each other.
