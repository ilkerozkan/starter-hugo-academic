  Subtle details in medical images can be crucial in disease diagnosis.
  Therefore, these images need to be analyzed accurately and precisely. Capsule
  Networks (CapsNet) take into account the spatial and hierarchical
  relationships of the objects in the image by storing information such as
  orientation, color, texture, etc. in capsules and can perform well with a
  small amount of data. The use of these advantages of CapsNet in the healthcare
  field can enable accurate and precise diagnosis of diseases. However, the
  feature extraction phase of traditional CapsNet is insufficient to capture the
  details in medical images. The computational cost increases in deepening
  models to solve this problem. In this thesis, we aim to stabilize the
  computational cost while increasing the number of extracted features, and by
  using the advantageous aspects of CapsNet, three new CapsNet models with high
  reliability and accuracy in the classification of complex medical images are
  developed. In these models, the classification accuracy is improved by
  deepening CapsNet layers. In the studies, residual blocks were utilized in
  order to avoid the vanishing gradient problem of increasing layers. In the
  first study, the FractalNet module with skip connections such as residual
  block and residual block is used and a new squash function is proposed. In the
  second study, the effect of the architecture consisting of parallel lanes
  instead of the current back-to-back architecture on the classification
  performance of CapsNet is investigated. The effect of the number of residual
  blocks on classification is also observed. In the third study, the aim was to
  reduce the increased number of parameters resulting from the deepened network
  in order to improve the classification performance of CapsNet. The residual
  block and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) are used instead of
  the convolution layer of CapsNet. The residual block increased the number of
  features extracted and CBAM selected the important ones. This reduced the
  number of features to be processed and the number of parameters of the model.
  Various medical datasets and the CIFAR10 dataset with complex images were used
  to evaluate these proposed approaches. These datasets include retinal images,
  blood cell images, chest X-ray images, skin lesion images, and brain MRI
  images. The performance values obtained from the experimental studies show
  that the proposed approaches improve the ability of the existing CapsNet model
  to classify medical images and make the CapsNet model more stable.
