abstract: 'Including uncertainties such as the performance of the teams, player performance
  indicators, and the quality of the competitors, there are numerous factors affecting
  the result of a game. Therefore, prediction of the game results is quite a complicated
  and a conspicuous research problem. Various artificial intelligence models were
  developed in order to solve this problem. By drawing together the advantageous sides
  of various artificial methods, this study aims to develop a hybrid intelligent system
  in order to better predict the result of a basketball game. Firstly, a prediction
  model was developed via artificial neural network (ANN), which is frequently used
  in game result predictions. The success of this developed ANN model in predicting
  the result of the game was 70.8%. In order to increase this success rate, a new
  concurrent neuro fuzzy system (CNFS) was suggested which was combined with fuzzy
  logic system that determined whether the team was favorite. The accurate prediction
  rate increased to 79.2% via this suggested CNFS model. Moreover, the results of
  the models developed were compared with each other and previous studies predicting
  the game results. As the conclusion of the comparisons, it was observed that CNFS
  model had a remarkable talent in predicting the game results. '
