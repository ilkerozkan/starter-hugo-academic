abstract: 'AbstractIn the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which is one of the neural
  networks algorithms, the input weight and hidden bias value parameters are randomly
  selected and the output layer weights are calculated analytically. Therefore, the
  learning process of the network takes place quickly. In addition, the number of
  neurons needed by the hidden layer is higher than the gradient-based algorithms.
  Finding optimum values of entry weights and hidden neuron bias values affects the
  performance of the ELM. In this study, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Competitive
  Swarm Optimizer (CSO) were used to determine these optimum values. By determining
  the optimum input weights and hidden bias values, the output weights were analytically
  calculated by Moore-Penrose generalized inverse. By adapting the multi-class thyroid
  data set of ELM, CSO-ELM and PSO-ELM models, the best accuracy rates were obtained
  as 94.74%, 94.86%, 95.42% respectively. It has been seen that optimization methods
  increase the classification performance of the ELM models. '
