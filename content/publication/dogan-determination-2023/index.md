abstract: In order to increase the market value and quality of wheat, it is
  important to separate different types and determine the amount of foreign
  matter using the visual properties of durum and bread wheat. In this study,
  the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, which is often preferred in
  real-time applications, was used to make classifications using features
  obtained from images containing the wheat kernel and foreign matter. The
  feature selection process was applied to remove the irrelevant ones from the
  obtained 236 features. In addition, the Harris hawksâ€™ optimizer (HHO), a novel
  method in the literature, and the particle swarm optimizer (PSO), one of the
  well-known algorithms, were used to improve the ELM model. As part of this
  study, new models called HHO-ELM and PSO-ELM were created and compared with
  the original ELM model and other artificial neural networks (ANNs) studies
  published in the literature. As a result, in comparison with other models, the
  optimized ELM models demonstrated good stability and accuracy, having 99.32%
  in binary classification and 95.95% in multi-class classification.
