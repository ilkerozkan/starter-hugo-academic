  The presence of hair in dermoscopy images poses significant challenges for the
  diagnosis and analysis of skin lesions, particularly for melanoma, the most
  lethal type of skin cancer. Hair occlusion can significantly hinder the
  diagnostic process, making accurate segmentation critically important. This
  study evaluates the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
  architectures U-Net, ResU-Net, and AttU-Net in the task of hair segmentation
  in dermoscopy images, including comparisons across various image resolutions.
  Simulation results indicate that the proposed system can detect and segment
  hair with mean scores of 0.7438 and 0.6211 for the Dice score and Jaccard
  index, respectively. The findings suggest that especially in high-resolution
  dermoscopy images, U-Net models significantly improve hair segmentation
  accuracy, potentially playing a critical role in early melanoma diagnosis.
