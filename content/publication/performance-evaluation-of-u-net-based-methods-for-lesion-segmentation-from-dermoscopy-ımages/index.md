  Skin cancer accounts for approximately half of all cancer cases worldwide,
  making it one of the most prevalent types of cancer. Melanoma, which develops
  from melanocytes that give skin its color, is the most lethal among skin
  cancers. Early diagnosis of melanoma, particularly through dermoscopy images,
  is of vital importance. To this end, automated diagnostic systems
  significantly aid dermatologists in their decision-making processes. In recent
  years, advancements in deep learning and machine learning have improved
  diagnostic accuracy. Specifically, CNN-based deep learning algorithms are
  utilized for medical image analysis and skin lesion segmentation. While
  traditional methods struggle to capture fine details and broader context, the
  U-Net architecture overcomes these challenges, providing more accurate
  segmentation. This study evaluates U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net
  models for skin lesion segmentation. The performance of the models is measured
  using Dice Score, Jaccard Index, and train loss metrics. The results reveal
  that Attention U-Net demonstrates the highest performance, with a Dice Score
  of 0.8063 and a Jaccard Index of 0.7203.
