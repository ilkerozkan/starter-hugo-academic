abstract: "Previously theoretical and experimental study was realized for magnetic filter performance according to magnetic field and magnetic susceptibility of the particles. In this study, a fuzzy expert system is designed. In this system, magnetic field strength and particle diameter are selected as input parameters and filter performance is selected as output parameter. All parameters are fuzzified by linguistic expressions. Fuzzy data is evaluated by mamdani fuzzy rule base. And centroid defuzzification method is chosen to get resulted crisp data. FES results and theoretical results are statically analyzed Then, these results and theoretical and experimental data are evaluated. As a result, it is found that mentioned FES can be used in place of theoretical study and experimental work with confidence interval 97. 9%."
