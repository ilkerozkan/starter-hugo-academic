abstract: In this study, a model for the relation between magnetic filter (MF)
  performance and time was developed by artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN
  model is includes a hidden layer. The input parameters are concentration of
  magnetic particles in output of MF and time. The output parameter is MF
  performance. The estimation performance of ANN is evaluated by using sum of
  squared errors (SSE), correlation coefficient (R2 ) and mean relative errors
  (MRE). The ANN model resulted in a good regression analysis for test data set
  in which the R2 is 0.999857, SSE is 0.000132 and MRE is 1.004543. The
  regression coefficient shows that ANN approach with high level of accuracy can
  be considered as an alternative and practical technique to estimate
  performance parameters for MFs. The model enables us to estimate the variable
  characteristics of filter performance and time used in the cleaning process of
  industrial liquid. These estimated results provide solutions to be used for
  the optimization and control of magnetic filtration process and also new
  filter designs.
