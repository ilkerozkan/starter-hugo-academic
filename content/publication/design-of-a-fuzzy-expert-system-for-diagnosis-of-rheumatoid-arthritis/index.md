  The disease of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic, and
  autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease which is seen in multiple joints at
  the same time and has an unknown aetiology, and of which clinical course
  varies from patient to patient. The early recognition and the knowledge of
  severity of the RA disease is very important for treatment to be conducted.
  The physical examination of the patient, laboratory tests, and medical story
  are needed to diagnose the condition of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The laboratory
  findings to be used in the diagnosis of the disease are not specific to
  Rheumatoid Arthritis, and these findings are used to support the diagnosis
  made according to the clinical indications and in evaluating the course of the
  disease. In this thesis, a Fuzzy Expert System (FES) is designed to assist
  doctors in diagnosing the disease and to help doctors make decisions by
  getting help from a specialist in his field of study. For this FES, it has
  been used the laboratory tests of CRP (C-Reactive Protein), Sedim, RF
  (Rheumatoid Factor), and ANA (Anti-Nuclear Antibody) that were determined the
  specialist. The system has been designed by the results of these tests, the
  medical stories of the patients, and the specialist doctor's views using the
  MATLAB program, and its accuracy has been checked. Uniting the FES result with
  the patient's story and the values of Anti-CCP (Anti Cyclic Citrullinated
  Peptide Antibody), it has been concluded in the diagnosis of RA disease. A
  website has been published for the use of doctors and patients by the designed
  FES was coded in a web-based PHP programming language. It has been found that
  the diagnosis made on the basis of the FES via the website, the diagnosis by
  the specialist doctors, and the diagnosis made according to 2010 ACR / EULAR
  Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria are compatible with each other,
  and the system has been approved by the specialist doctor. Keywords: Disease
