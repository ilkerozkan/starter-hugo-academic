 abstract = {In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) model is developed for estimation of cutting forces during the process of lathe operation. In ANN model, cutting forces and temperature empirical data obtained from different cutting conditions at the lathe operation are used. The developed model can also estimate cutting forces and temperature values at different cutting conditions obtained from experiments. The results obtained from developed model and experiments were compared. Analysis shows that he correlation rate between these two methods is 0,988. As result, it has been seen that implemented ANN model is reliable for estimation of cutting forces.},
