abstract: " There are a lot of factors like particle size, concentration and
  flow rate which affect the performance of the Electromagnetic Filter (EMF)
  used for cleaning of industrial filters. In this study, an FPGA based PI type
  fuzzy control system is designed and realized considering the all parameters
  affecting the EMF performance. Realized controller has been integrated in EMF
  kit and used for cleaning of industrial liquids. Results of the  performed
  experiments and previous literature results are given with their differences
  in EMF structures. "
