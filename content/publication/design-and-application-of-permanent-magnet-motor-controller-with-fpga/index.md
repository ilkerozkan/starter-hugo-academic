  The permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) are the sinusoidal motors with
  the supply current and the induced voltage waveform. In general, AC and DC can
  be fed from one source. They react quickly to the applied voltage. Due to the
  limitations in the mechanical design of PMSM, the flux in the air gap is not
  regular. This irregularity causes momentum fluctuation in the motor. This
  fluctuation problem can be solved by using various controllers in the
  controller structure. In the literature, PMSMs are controlled by different
  control methods such as direct torque control (DTC), field-oriented control
  (FOC). Various feedback systems have been used to eliminate the problem of
  torque fluctuation and PI controller is the most widely used. In this study,
  PMSM structures and control methods were examined. The advantages and
  disadvantages of the FPGA based PMSM controller structures have been examined
  in recent years. In addition, an FPGA controller has been designed to control
  the PMSM with the vector control method. In order to avoid moment fluctuations
  during the control, a PI controller, and the current data received from each
  phase as feedback used in the controller.
