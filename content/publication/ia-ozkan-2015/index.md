abstract: "Prostate cancer is a very common type of cancer which is seen in men and the early detection of prostate cancer is possible with prostate specific antigen test. In this study, a type-2 fuzzy expert system has been designed which is able to calculate the risk of prostate cancer according to prostate-specific antigen (PSA), age and prostate volume (PV) input parameters. The obtained results have been compared with specialists diagnose and literature data. And as a result, it is seen that the system can be used safely. Performed results of type-2 fuzzy prostate cancer risk system helps for assessing clinical status of patients and healthcare professionals for diagnosing a complex diagnosis."
