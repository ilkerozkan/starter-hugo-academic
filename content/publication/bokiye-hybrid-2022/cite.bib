 abstract = {Load balancing and task scheduling are the main challenges in Cloud Computing. Existing load balancing algorithms have a drawback in considering the capacity of virtual machines while distributing loads among them. The proposed algorithm works toward solving existing issues, such as fair load distribution, avoiding underloading and overloading, and improving response time. It implements best practices of Throttled load balancing algorithm and Equally Shared Current Execution algorithm. Virtual machines are selected based on the ratio of their bandwidth and load allocation count. Requests are sent to a Virtual Machine with higher bandwidth and lower load allocation count. Proposed algorithm checks for the availability of VM based on their capacity. This process is performed by selecting two VMs and comparing their vmWeight capacity. The one with the least vmWeight is selected. CloudAnalyst is used for simulation, response time evaluation, and resource utilization evaluation. The simulation result of the proposed algorithm is compared with three well-known load-balancing algorithms. These are Round Robin, Throttled Load balancing algorithm, and Enhanced Active Monitoring. Load-balancing Proposed Algorithm selects VMs based on their Algorithm. The proposed algorithm has improved over other algorithms in load distribution, response time, and resource utilization. All virtual machines in the data centers are loaded with a relatively equal number of tasks according to their capacity. This resulted in fair resource sharing and load distribution.},
