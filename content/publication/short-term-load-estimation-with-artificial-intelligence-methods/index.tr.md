  Electric load estimation is very important in efficient operation of power
  systems and future planning. Load estimation is based on estimating the future
  electrical load by examining past conditions. Daily or hourly electricity
  consumption data are generally used for short term load estimation. In this
  study, Turkey's four-year, short-term load forecasting modeling was done using
  daily electricity consumption data. In this modeling, past electrical load
  values and temperature values are used as input. In order to increase the
  prediction accuracy, the days were categorized according to their
  characteristics and classified according to the seasons. MAPE values were
  calculated in the study. Among the models developed with ANN, the best MAPE
  value was obtained as 2.51% and the worst MAPE value was 4.48%. When the
  season criterion is added, a more successful MAPE value was obtained.
