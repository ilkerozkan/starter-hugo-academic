  The classification of medical images enables physicians to perform expeditious
  and accurate data analysis, increasing the chances of timely disease diagnosis
  and early intervention to the patient. However, classification is a
  time-consuming and labour intensive process when done manually. The Capsule
  Network (CapsNet) architecture has advantages in accurately and quickly
  classifying medical images due to its ability to evaluate images within
  part-whole relationships, robustness to data rotations and affine
  transformations, and good performance on small datasets. However, CapsNet may
  demonstrate low performance on complex datasets. In this study, a new CapsNet
  model named MResCaps is proposed to overcome this disadvantage and enhance its
  performance on complex images. MResCaps utilizes an increasing number of
  residual blocks in each layer in parallel lane to obtain rich feature maps at
  different levels, aiming to achieve high success in the classification of
  various medical images. To evaluate the model's performance, the CIFAR10
  dataset and the DermaMNIST, PneumoniaMNIST, and OrganMNIST-S datasets from the
  MedMNIST dataset collection are used. MResCaps outperformed CapsNet by 20% in
  terms of accuracy on the CIFAR10 dataset. In addition, AUC values of 96.25%,
  96.30%, and 97.12% were achieved in DermaMNIST, PneumoniaMNIST, and
  OrganMNIST-S datasets, respectively. The results show that the proposed new
  model MResCaps improves the performance of CapsNet in the classification of
  complex and medical images. Furthermore, the model has demonstrated a better
  performance in comparison with extant studies in the literature. This study
  aims to contribute significantly to the literature by introducing a novel
  perspective on CapsNet-based architectures for the classification of medical
  images through a parallel-laned architecture and a rich feature
  capsule-focused approach.
