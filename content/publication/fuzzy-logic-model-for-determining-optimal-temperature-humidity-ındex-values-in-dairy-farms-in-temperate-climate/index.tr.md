  In livestock, temperature, humidity, and Temperature-Humidity Index (THI)
  affect the welfare, yields, health and viability of animals. This study aimed
  to develop optimal temperature, humidity, and THI thresholds for dairy farms
  in temperate climate regions using a fuzzy logic model. THI values were
  calculated using three different literature-derived equations, considering
  different temperature and humidity situations in dairy farms. The Mamdani-type
  fuzzy logic method was utilized to formulate linguistic expressions for
  temperature, humidity, and THI values. According to the THI thresholds, the
  areas below the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) were found to be
  significant (p < 0.001) in all fuzzy algorithms. The study found 100% harmony
  with the THI thresholds of 66 and 72 for cattle in temperate climates, but
  only 73.6% harmony with the threshold of 74 for cattle adapted to tropical
  climate. Briefly, in temperate dairy farms, the fuzzy logic revealed that the
  optimal temperature, humidity and THI values should be between 14–18.5°C,
  65–70% and 52.5–64.5, respectively. However, further research is required to
  understand the impact of thresholds determined by fuzzy logic on dairy cow
  production and welfare.
