  In this study, an artificial neural network has been devised that yields a
  prognostic result indicating whether patients have cancer or not using their
  free prostate-specific antigen, total prostate-specific antigen and age data.
  Though this system does not diagnose cancer conclusively, it helps the doctor
  in deciding whether a biopsy is necessary by providing information about
  whether the patient has prostate cancer or not. Data from 121 patients who
  were definitively diagnosed with cancer after biopsy were used in devising the
  system. The results of the definitive diagnoses of the patients and the
  results of the ANN that was performed were analysed using confusion matrix and
  ROC analyses. As a result of ANN, which was implemented on the basis of these
  analyses, success rates of 94.11% and 94.44% were achieved for prognosis of
  disease and validity, respectively. The ANN, which yielded these high rates of
  reliability, will help doctors make quick and reliable diagnoses without any
  risks and make it a better option to monitor patients with low prostate cancer
  risk on whom biopsies must not be carried out through a policy of wait and
  see.
