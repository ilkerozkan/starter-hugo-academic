  Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully used in the
  classification of medical images. However, CNNs extract the features of the
  image, neglecting the spatial information between the objects since they
  evaluate each object separately and this makes it difficult to analyse images
  reliably. CapsNets partially overcomes these limitations by encapsulating the
  objects in the image and their feature parameters without losing the spatial
  information between objects. However, this advantage of CapsNet can become a
  disadvantage due to the fact that CapsNet stores a lot of information, which
  can lead to an increase in the number of parameters and the complexity of the
  network. In this study, a new method is proposed in which residual block and
  CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) modules are used hybridly with
  CapsNet in order to classify medical images with high accuracy and reliability
  and, at the same time, to overcome this disadvantage of CapsNet by reducing
  the number of parameters. In this study, more features of the image are
  extracted by using the residual block instead of the convolutional layer of
  CapsNet. The attention mechanism is used to increase the effectiveness of
  important features and reduce the effect of unnecessary features. In addition,
  the residual block and CBAM module reduced the number of parameters in CapsNet
  by approximately 2 million. Brain tumour images and OCT (Optical Coherence
  Tomography) images were classified with the proposed model. The results of the
  study show that the proposed model achieves significant results when compared
  to other CapsNet-based studies in the literature.
