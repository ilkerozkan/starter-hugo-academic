 abstract = {One of the most important calculation operation in many systems is the calculation of the square root of numbers. In digital systems and digital signal processing there are some different algorithms to calculate the square root of numbers. Designing of the square root calculator depends on the algorithm or method for the programming format. The Babylonian method was examined and used as a different approach in this study. The digital square root calculator designed is mainly based on the Babylonian method and design was implemented with VHDL language.},
