 abstract = {Electromagnetic filters (EMF) are used to clean magnetic particles in industrial liquids which play important roles to sustain the high-quality material production in industrial fields. In this study, an FPGA-based adaptive fuzzy controller is realized to sustain high performance of an EMF. An experiment is performed by using realized adaptive controller on an EMF set. The results obtained from the experiment are compared with the results of the conventional fuzzy controller. It is observed that adaptive fuzzy controller is performed better than the conventional fuzzy controller.},
