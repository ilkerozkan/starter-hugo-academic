abstract: "The ever-increasing spread of the use of the Internet in intelligence technologies has begun to revolutionise the entire economy (from production to commerce, tourism to publishing) and all phases of education; briefly, all aspects of life. As a consequence of the impact of rapid growth of use of the Internet on education, the idea of \"Net-Aided Education\" has become common and its application has increased. The fact that Net-Aided Education (NAE) has numerous advantages over conventional methods has impelled a number of educational institutions to reorganise accordingly. This research has been conducted using the course management system Moodle portal for Department of Electronics and Computer at Faculty of Technical Education of University of Sel√ßuk, to compare NAE with the conventional method for the subject of Technical Drawing. Statistical analysis and evaluation of NAE and conventional methods have been carried out. Consequently, success rates of the group that learned using NAE and the group that learned using conventional methods have been compared. The statistical analyses have indicated a major gap in favour of the group that learned using NAE. INTRODUCTION Progress in the field of the Internet is bringing about progress in the field of education. Net-Aided Education (NAE), contrary to common educational technologies, emerges as a new educational model in the field of education as an able rival of conventional methods. NAE is recognised as a real-time target-behaviour developing process that utilises net-based web applications in its infrastructure and that suggests that the one that teaches and the one that is taught are in different circumstances in terms of place and time [1]. NAE provides the teachers and learners with a suitable environment by keeping in mind the variations of learning style and capabilities of individuals and by making it possible for learning process to continue anywhere and anytime other than regular lessons [2]. Besides, because there exist fewer teaching professionals than necessary and more students than can be assisted individually in many educational institutions in our country, a desired level of regular teaching can not be achieved. As the employment of NAE spreads, it makes it possible for institutions that have a sufficient number of teaching professional to teach the students of the institutions that are in need [3]. With NAE applied on a concrete example, as an addition to regular classes, it is possible to create a supplementary environment independent of time and place, using such utilities as online tests, surveys, demonstrations and animated education, which are provided by course management system. NET-AIDED EDUCATION NAE disposes the educators of the problem of time and place, which are the two greatest restrictions of conventional methods. The most important problem of education (i.e. of lack of time, place and educators) makes such methods as NAE an indispensable companion of conventional methods. Learning that is based on the Internet equips the students with the opportunity to access information, without having to conform to a designated time and place. Additionally, NAE affects the students' level of education positively by also teaching them how to keep their knowledge updated all through their lives [4]. In conventional education, speeches made in the classroom are supported by body language and sentence intonation. It is not easy to achieve this via NAE, nevertheless, the students have the opportunity to think over as long as they like before answering to a question, or individuals that are timid can put forward their thoughts in a relaxed manner. In on-line education, students can also go back in history and revise at will. In NAE, the educator is more of a person that points to information rather than one that distributes it."
